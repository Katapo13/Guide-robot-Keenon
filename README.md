# Guide-robot-Keenon
Создание программного обеспечения для робота- экскурсовода на основе робота Keenon 

## PROJECTION
### We, as cool business analysts, must find out the requirements from our beloved lab owner: what are the expectations from the final product (software/functional)
* How does the tour proceed/is it controlled by a fantastic tour guide (taking into account the trajectory; there's a guide with a remote control who controls/starts the tour)
* How should the trajectory/circle be set?
* Should the audience (people) be identified?
### Find out the available software components//go to the lab to collect information (what it's written in, what it supports)
### Create a development plan: select libraries, consider that the user must be able to expand the tour program (external software, remote control, or downloading a database containing exhibits, the corresponding program (update)
PS. There must be a cool person who will update the tour program programmatically, or learn how to adapt it).
### Based on the information collected, begin developing components, testing, and gradually recording the results.
If the project is unfinished, draw up a plan for the missing developed elements (report).
### Design the results, the user's upload method
